# Modern Portfolio Theory (MPT) Report

This repository contains source files of Modern Portfolio Theory report.
The report was written in the 3rd semester for probability theory.
## Reference

Most of the code was taken from the article [Modern Portfolio Theory by Gregory Gundersen](https://gregorygundersen.com/blog/2021/05/04/portfolio-theory/#a2-code-to-generate-figure-333).

I just replaced some parts of the code and added a one(A3.py), due to its absence in the original article
